    <h3>Discription:</h3>
    <p>There are two types of chilli paneer that are popular in India â€“ the dry version which is served as an appetizer and the gravy version which is eaten as a main course with rice or noodles.</p>
    <p>I am sharing a semi-dry version with you guys today. It has a little sauce and you can serve it as an appetizer or even as a main course.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingridents:-</strong></p>
 
    <ul> 
        <li>sesame oil</li>
        <li>green chili sauce</li>
        <li>rice vinegar</li>
        <li> tomato ketchup and sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Making/steps:-</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut paneer into cubes. To a large bowl, add 3 tablespoons cornstarch, 3 tablespoons flour along with salt, pepper.</li>
        <li> Add water to make a free flowing batter, it should neither be thick nor thin. I added little less than 1/2 cup water here. Meanwhile heat oil in a wok/kadai on medium heat to deep fry the paneer.</li>
        <li>Dip each paneer cube into the batter.</li>`
        <li>And then add them into the hot oil.</li>
        <li>Fry until the paneer pieces get golden brown and crispy from both sides. Drain the fried paneer on paper towel.</li>
        <li> Heat sesame oil and avocado oil in wok on medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add the ginger, garlic, celery and green chili. Saute for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Then add the quartered onion and peppers.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2 minutes. Veggies should remain crunchy and you should cook on high heat.</li>
        <li> Then add in the prepared cornstarch slurry. Mix well, sauce will begin to thicken. Add additional 3 to 4 tablespoons water.</li>
        <li>Stir in the fried paneer cubes. Toss to combine the paneer with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and garnish with green onions.</li>
        
    </ol>
